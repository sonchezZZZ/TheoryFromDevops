# What is orchestration

**DevOps orchestration** is the automation of numerous processes that run concurrently in order to reduce production issues and time to market, while automation is the capacity to do a job or a series of procedures to finish an individual task repeatedly. 

Tools to manage, scale, and maintain containerized applications are called **orchestrators**, and the most common examples of these are Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. Development environment deployments of both of these orchestrators are provided by Docker Desktop, which weâ€™ll use throughout this guide to create our first orchestrated, containerized application.

# Docker Swarm

## Configure Docker swarm on instances 

On Master node: 
```sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr master-ip```

On worker node 
``` sudo docker swarm join --token TOKEN ip:port```

## Commands 

- **docker node ls** - node list
- **docker node rm node-id** - delete node 
- **docker info** - swarm info
- **docker swarm leave** - unset worker node
- **docker swarm join-token worker** - get joining command for worker node
- **docker swarm join-token manager** - get joining command for master node
- **docker service create --name fun -replicas 3 -p 80:80 httpd**
- **docker service ls**
- **docker service ps service-name**
- **docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yaml fun** - create deployment
- **docker service scale svc-name=3**
- **docker service update --image image-name/version service-id**
